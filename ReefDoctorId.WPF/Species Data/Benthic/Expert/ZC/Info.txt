Zoanthids look like little cogs of about 1cm diameter, that have a mouth in their centre and are surrounded by little 'teeth-like' tentacles.
Zoanthids can live separately or in colonies where they are connected to each other just like most corals.
To avoid confusion with some massive and encrusting corals whose corallites resemble zooanthids' polyps; perform the 'waft test'. The zooanthid polyps close.
