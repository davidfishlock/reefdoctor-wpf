Stiff tissue with a skeleton similar to that of soft corals but with a matrix of hard elements called spicules.
Patterns of these spicules can often be seen from the surface like splinters in the tissue or irregular lumps over the surface.
Sponges can be encrusting, small protruding structures, or massive, stocky structures securely attached to the bottom.
