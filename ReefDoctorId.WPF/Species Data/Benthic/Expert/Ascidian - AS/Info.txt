Ascidians (or tunicates or sea squirts) can easily be confused with encrusting sponges because of their irregular growth. They are also filter feeders and so are covered in inhalant and exhalent holes.
However, they are much more complex organisms than sponges and the holes will CLOSE if you waft your hand over them. Sponges will not do this!
Ascidians also tend to have a more shiny surface than sponges (which are matt/dull colored).
Can be solitary or colonial.
