Seagrasses are flowering plants that mostly occur in large meadows. They provide nurseries, shelter and food to a variety of marine species. They are not common on reefs but are around, so you might come across them if a part of your transect is led over sand.
Some of the species around in Ifaty are: Halodule uninervis, Thalassia hemprichii, Syringodium isoetifolium.
