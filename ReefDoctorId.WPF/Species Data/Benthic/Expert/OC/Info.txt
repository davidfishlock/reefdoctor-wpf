Clams are sessile molluscs. They filter-feed small animals from the water and, like corals contain zooxanthellae algae with which they share a 'food-sharing' symbiotic relationship.
If the transect covers the fleshy part of the clam it is classed as OC. If the transect covers the shell then the classification will be rock (RCN or RCC).
