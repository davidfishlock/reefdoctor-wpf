Calcium carbonate skeleton that will not move when wafted.
Visible corallites (the skeleton deposited by each polyp). Polyps are mostly out at night, therefore only corallites are visible during the day.
A sandpaper-like or knobby surface (all the corallites of the colony).
Polyps have 6 or multiple of 6 tentacles (EXCEPT: blue coral, and organ pipe coral which have 8, and fire coral which is 'fuzzy' looking).
Different morphologies exist - encrusting hard corals are sometimes overlooked.
Hard corals that feed during the day exist. Don't be thrown off by those that does and can look like soft corals at first glance.
