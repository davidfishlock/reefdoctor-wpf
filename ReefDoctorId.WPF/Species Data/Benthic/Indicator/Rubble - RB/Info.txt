As rubble is unattached to the reef, wave action will make it tumble around, which may knock off any new corals that have settled.
When rubble has been 'cemented' together by coralline algae, we call it rock as it is no longer unstable - this can cause confusion among surveyors.
If it is loose or free to roll around it is rubble. If it is no longer loose and is cemented together it is rock.
