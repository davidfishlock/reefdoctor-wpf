Killed during the last year. This means that corallites will not be very eroded and you can tell which genus it belongs to. If the corallites have been eroded down and are covered in encrusting organisms or coralline algae, then it is classified as rock.
The skeleton may still be white if very recently killed because it is made out of limestone. It may be slightly overgrown by algae as this may not take long to settle. Look under the algae for corallites that are not eroded and/or whiteish skeleton.
