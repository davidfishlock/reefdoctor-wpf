Surface often matt or dull.
Simple organisms with no set shape. Think IRREGULAR!
Can assume a variety of shape and sizes from small encrusting animals to large tube, barrel foliose forms.
To tell these from hard corals, waft them, and they will sway. 
To tell them from soft corals, look closely at the surface for irregular texture, covered in different size holes. These hole will NOT close up if you waft your hand over them.
To tell them from ascidians perform the waft test again. The holes will close if it's an ascidian. Ascidians also often tend to have a more shiny colorful surface.
