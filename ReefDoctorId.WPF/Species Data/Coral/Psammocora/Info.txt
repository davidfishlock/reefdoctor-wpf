Colonies are massive, submassive, laminar, or encrusting.
Calices are very small 1-2 mm in diameter.
Corallites are immersed, small and shallow, sometimes forming a valley.
Calice forms a distinctive black pit.
Septo-costae have granulated/serrated margins, which resolves any possible confusion with Pavona which have smooth (or at least only minutely ridged) septo-costae.
