Thick encrusting to flat or dome shaped massive structures.
Corallites range from 3mm - 15mm and are very clearly plocoid.
Septa are very neatly arranged and long and short alternate in a distinctive pattern in most species.
Corallite walls are very clearly defined.
Small paliform lobes are usually visible.
Septa are minutely toothed, often giving them a serrated edge visible on close inspection underwater.
New corallites are usually formed by extratentacular budding, although some species display both forms of budding.
