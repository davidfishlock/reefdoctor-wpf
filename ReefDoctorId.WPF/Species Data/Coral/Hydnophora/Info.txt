Colonies are massive, branching or encrusting to submassive.
Colonies are cerioid and almost uniquely, common walls intersect, thicken and form prominent conical mounds called monticules or hydnophores.
Tentacles will be extended from around the base of the monticules and the polyps in the pseudo valleys.
