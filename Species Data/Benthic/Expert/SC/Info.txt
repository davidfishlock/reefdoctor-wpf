Soft corals do not build reefs as their skeleton is made from soft tissues that is supported internally like re-enforced concrete by a matrix of calcareous elements.
Waft the water column and the structure will move (flexible skeleton).
Regular corallites visible ; occasionally with polyps extended during the day (tentacles in multiples of 8).
