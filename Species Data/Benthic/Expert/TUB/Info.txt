Organ pipe coral is in fact a soft coral. However, it is unusual for soft corals in that it makes a hard, red skeleton and is, therefore, a reef-builder.
If you see this coral, waft the polyps gently and see them retract into a red skeleton… but remember that red is filtered out of the water at shallow depths so this skeleton may look brownish underwater.
