Sand is a natural component of coral reefs. This category helps us to see when the transect hits a sandy patch in-between the reef area. If you are unsure as to whether it is sand or silt, pick a bit up and drop it. If it falls straight to the ground, it is sand. If it forms a cloud in the water column, it is silt.
Sand doesn't provide us with much information on a survey - so we try to avoid sand on the surveys. However it will still happen that we come across some patches of sand.
