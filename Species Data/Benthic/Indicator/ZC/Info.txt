Zoanthids are a small group of predominantly colonial, anemone-like forms (without a pedal disk) that are common on tropical reefs. They can potentially cover large areas and therefore be a competitor for space with reef-forming corals.
Corallimorphs are another small group closely related to the hard corals but lack a calcareous skeleton. Corallimorph tentacles are also generally in radial rows, more like an anemone.
