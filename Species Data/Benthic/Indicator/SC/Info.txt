Soft corals do not build reefs as their skeleton is made from soft tissue that is supported internally by a matrix of individual calcareous elements.
Soft corals can be differentiated from hard corals by wafting the water column; soft corals' superstructure will move. Many soft corals will also have their polyps out during the daytime and you can count their 8 tentacles (Octocorals).
Polyps always have 8 tentacles, which are hairy-looking.
Polyps are often day feeders.
Smooth texture with small, regular holes if polyps are retracted.
Surface of some soft corals can appear leathery or rubbery.
