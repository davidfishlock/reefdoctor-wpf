Coral that has been dead for over a year is classified as rock.
Rubble that has been 'cemented' together by coralline algae is also counted in this category.
It is still classified as rock if it is covered in turf algae, less than a few centimeters long or if it is covered in coralline algae.
Any type of clams shell is also included.
