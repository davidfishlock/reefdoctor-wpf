Drupella snails feed on live coral - frequently branching Acropora sp. and Pocillopora sp. corals.
The snail's shell is often coated with coralline algae and therefore appears to have a matt, purple finish.
Drupella have a tongue that has little teeth on it to form a sandpaper-like surface, called a radula
During feeding they scrape away the tissue from the limestone skeleton with their radula, and the scars left behind from Drupella are therefore ragged or messy with bits of tissue hanging off
