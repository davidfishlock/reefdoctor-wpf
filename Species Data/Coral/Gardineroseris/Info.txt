Colonies are massive to encrusting, sometimes laminar margins.
There is only one species, Gardineroseris planulata.
Acute, geometric walls with fine, even septo-costae.
Corallites are shallow and rounded.
Can be confused with certain Goniastrea, but Gardineroseris has far finer septa, also, watch for the laminar edge (the edge is slightly lifted).
