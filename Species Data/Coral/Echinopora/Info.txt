Wide variety of growth forms from encrusting through foliaceous and branching.
Corallite are plocoid and calices average 10mm with walls often the same size.
Coenosteum, septa and costae are toothed, giving colonies a very granulated appearance.
Paliform lobes can be well developed in some species.
Corallites may be oriented at odd angles, giving the colony an untidy appearance.
Tentacles are only extended at night.
Most similar to Cyphastrea, which is differentiated by smaller corallites, thinner walls, massive growth form, neater corallite orientation.
