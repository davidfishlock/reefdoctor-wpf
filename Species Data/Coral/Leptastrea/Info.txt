Thick encrusting plates to massive.
Corallites are small, 2mm - 5mm and are cerioid to sub-plocoid.
Corallites are very closely packed, and in some species may protrude unevenly.
Costae are very poorly developed (or non-existent) and as such the outside of the corallite, and the coenosteum if it is visible, often appears smooth.
Septa project strongly inwards and paliform lobes are rarely visible.
The surface of the corallites is usually pale and whitish, giving them an eroded appearance.
