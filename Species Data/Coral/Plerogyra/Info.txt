Colonies are encrusting to massive.
Only one species is found here (P. sinuosa). 
The flabello-meandroid structure is hard to distinguish as they are usually covered with the large grape-like vesicles distinctive to this genus. 
Vesicles inflated with water when tentacles are retracted during the day
The vesicles (which contain nematocysts) will retract slowly if it is disturbed to reveal large, solid septa.
